As AI advances, the concept of "everyone is a scientist" becomes attainable. Vertical AI is expanding human capabilities to scientist level across multiple disciplines. However, centralized control of AI resources and insufficient open-source incentives hinder the collaboration, and equitable value distributions.

## ❓Problem
While open-source AI for science promotes collaboration, contributors face fragmented access and lack equitable rewards. Existing blockchain solutions often underestimate the complexities of co-building AI, relying on centralized servers, closed point systems, and governance models influenced by major token holders. Consequently, off-chain AI contributions—such as code commits on GitHub or user feedback—remain under-incentivized and poorly recognized.

## 🔧 Core Product: Decentralized AI4Science OS with hyperscalability
Hetu offers an AI4Science OS built on decentralized model graphs, coupled with causal dependency tracking. This enables impartial incentives for vertical model creators and contributors:
- Decentralized Model Graphs: Transparently link and verify AI models and data, ensuring traceable contributions with 1 million QPS/subgraph.
- Causal Dependency Tracking (POCW): The Proof of Causality Work consensus accurately evaluates each contributor’s work, enabling fairer incentives with 100x throughput.
- Hyper-Scalable Consensus: Hetu’s DAG-based layer 2 achieves over 160,000 TPS with sub-second confirmation—suitable for large-scale scientific models.

##  Unique Value Proposition: Impartial Value Distribution in AI4Science
Hetu's architecture enables verifiable and transparent auditing of open-source model contributions, rewarding teams and individuals in a purely decentralized manner. This fosters broader collaboration and continuous innovation.

## 🎯 Use Case: Bootstrapping ModelDAOs for Science
Hetu bootstraps open-source vertical models for science in tokenization model and service model: 
1) 🚀For fair and cost-effective attributions of ModelDAOs for science, Hetu provides instant accountability through verifiable model graph dependencies. 
2) ⚡️For broader and fairer incentives for ModelDAOs of science, Hetu provides verifiable impartiality via its hyper-scale modelchains. 
3) 🛡️For impartial and adaptive governance of ModelDAOs for science, Hetu provides anti-censorship voting and personalized privacy.
