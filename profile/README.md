## 🌟 What is Hetu
Hetu is an intersubjective attribution layer, bringing instant finality for off-chain systems. It is a hyper-scalable causality-based ground layer for deAIs, deSci, and longevity. Hetu is created by Advaita Labs with 10+ OSDI, SOSP, and NSDI papers in causality and distributed systems.

## 🔧 Core Technology: Causality-Based Hyperscale Finality
### ⚡️ Features
- Verifiable logical clocks by TEE
- Fast causal ordering of transactions and abstract AI events
- Hyperscale AI-Native chains using DAG technologies
- 160,000+ theoretical TPS

### 🏗️ Architecture
Hetu's architecture combines a hyperscale chain offering rapid finality with a coordination layer designed for seamless interoperability. By leveraging causal ordering, the chain achieves scalable transaction throughput and near-instant transaction settlement.

## 💫 Core Values: Interoperable Value Diffusion
- 🔄 Instant finality for value attribution on-chain
- 🔐 Transparent secure timestamping
- 📈 Hyper-scalable verifications
- 🤝 Interoperable ordering mechanisms
- 🛡️ Anti-censorship governance

## 🎯 Use Cases

### 🤖 For DeAIs
1. Hyperscale pre-confirmations for AI-related transactions
2. Real-time verifications for GPU platforms
3. Verifiable framework for data transmissions
4. Shared sequencing for AI-Native chains
5. Anti-censorship voting for AI governance

### 🧬 For DeSci & Longevity
1. Hyper scalable DeSci chains
2. Attribution for longevity public networks
3. Decentralized social layers for DeSci communities
