### What is Hetu
Hetu is the intersubjective attribution layer, bringing real-time finality for off-chain systems. It is a hyper-scalable causality-based ground layer for decentralized AI microservices. Hetu is created by Advaita Labs with 10+ OSDI, SOSP & NSDI publications in distributed systems.

### Technology:Causality Based Finality
- Features: With verifiable logical clocks for P2P network, Hetu enables causal sequencing for transactions and instant ordering for abstract AI events such as data transmissions.
- Architecture: Hetu has a heterogeneous architecture including a causality hub with Ethereum, and instant finality layer with Eigenlayer restaking. It also includes a Causality-Verification-Service (CVS) platform for AI governance and incentives. 
- Core Values: Hetu not only provides instant finality but also flexible finality guarantee. Hetu’s core values are hyper-scalable verifications, interoperable pre-confirmation and anti-censorship governance for DeAIs. Hetu bootstraps your AI systems in a cost-efficient manner within a disruptively decentralized framework.


### Use Cases: Ground Layer for DeAIs and other off-chain systems 
For fair compensations of DeAIs, Hetu works as the real-time verifications and finality. Also, 
Hetu could work as an anti-censorship sorter of AI tasks for transparent governance. Powered by Eigenlayer AVS and Ethereum Trust, Hetu will be the ground layer for AI AVS and decentralized AI microservices, including 1) Hyperscale pre-confirmations for AI-related transactions. 2) Real-time verifications and incentives for GPU platform, inference network and Edge AIs with lowest latency. 3) Shared sequencing for AI Native chains with accountable fairness. 4) Anti-censorship voting for AI governances especially for personalized AIs. 5)Verifiable framework for data-transmissions of AIFis with fast accountability. Also, Hetu can be used as an most efficient attribution layer for DePin, DeSocials & DeSci, which need the unified paradigm of real-time finality. 

### Vision: Intersubjective Consensus
With a unique philosophy of intersubjective consensus, Hetu is envisioned to drive breakthroughs of entanglement between humans and AIs. Hetu unifies power of decentralized science and community-first principles, aligning with Eigenlayer/Ethereum. Since 2021, we have completed core research and plan to publish testnet 1.0 in Q4 of 2024 and mainnet phase1 in Q2 of 2025.
