### What is Hetu
Hetu is the intersubjective attribution layer, verifiable causality network for decentralized microservices. Hetu is created by Advaita Labs, with 10+ papers published at top systems conferences.

### Technology
- Feature: With verifiable logical clocks and zero-knowledge proofs, Hetu enables causal ordering based hyper scalability.
- Architecture: Hetu is architectured with a layered approach, with key components including verifiable causality network, programmable timestamp, and intersubjective modular layer.
- Core Value: Hetu generates flexible consistency guarantees and intersubjectivity for heterogeneous systems. Its core value is to attribute off-chain to on-chain events for diverse incentive mechanisms without centralized trust, empowering mounting collaborations for off-chain microservices. 

### Use Cases
Hetu takes a different collaborative approach for decentralized AGI. Hetu could work with Eigenlayer as the AI AVS containers. Hetu can be utilized to generate consistent settlement for decentralized training networks, decentralized causality proof for GPU networks, and reputation system for decentralized agents and asynchronous incentive mechanisms for decentralized AI protocol mounting. Also, Hetu will provide the intersubjective collaborative stacks for Desci narratives.

Hetu unifies power of decentralized science and community-first principles, together with Eigenlayer/Ethereum ecosystems. Since 2020, we have completed core research and plan to publish testnet in Q3 and mainnet phase1 in Q4 of 2024. With a unique philosophy of intersubjective trust-minimizations, Hetu is envisioned to drive breakthroughs to enhance the entanglement between intelligence.
