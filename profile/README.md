## 🌟 What is Hetu
Hetu is the intersubjective attribution layer, coordinating AI for Science. It’s visioned to be the next generation of emerging social contract platform, bringing humanic intelligence to Ethereum.Hetu is created by Advaita Labs with 10+ OSDI, SOSP, and NSDI papers in causality and distributed systems.

## 🔧 Core Technology: Causality-Based Hyperscale Finality
### ⚡️ Features
- Verifiable logical clocks by TEE
- Fast causal ordering of transactions and abstract AI events such as training of user data
- Hyperscale AI-Native chains using DAG technologies
- 160,000+ theoretical TPS

### 🏗️ Architecture
Hetu’s architecture offers hyperscale parallel DAG layer2 chains offering rapid finality with scalable transaction throughput and instant transaction settlement. Meanwhile, its offchain attribution layer establishes a causality framework that unites disparate AI infrastructures, aligning them to interact collectively within a coherent, interoperable manner.

## 💫 Core Values: Interoperable Value Diffusion of AIs for Science
- 🚀 Instant finality for value attribution on-chain
- 🔐 Transparent secure timestamping
- 📈 Hyper-scalable verifications
- 🔄 Interoperable Ordering Mechanisms for Incentivization
- 🛡️ Anti-censorship governance
- 🌱 Empowering DeSci Infrastructures
- 🤝 Supporting Collaborative Agent Network

## 🎯 Use Cases: Interoperatable Ground Layer to Coordinate AIs for science

### 🤖 For DeAIs
1. Hyperscale pre-confirmations for AI-related transactions
2. Real-time verifications for GPU platforms
3. Verifiable TEE framework for data transmissions
4. Shared sequencing for AI-Native chains
5. Anti-censorship voting for AI governance

### 🧬 For DeSci & Longevity
1. Hyper scalable DeSci chains
2. Attribution for longevity public networks
3. Decentralized social layers for DeSci communities
