Hetu is building a deeply entangled intersubjective reality where humans and intelligence co-create.
Our mission is to dissolve the trust gap between humans and intelligence, evolving towards a self-incentivized, self-evolving, self-operating society of deep intelligence.

## Mainnet ‚Äî Foundational Pillars
| Pillar                       | Role                               | Output                                          | Layer          |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| **Deep Intelligence Market** | Capital Formation for Intelligence | Monetization, stablecoin liquidity, agent IPOs  | Economic Layer |
| **Truth Engine**             | Attribution & Consensus            | Causal graphs, incentives, trustless audit      | Truth Layer    |
| **Hyper-Scalable Layer 2**   | Execution for Scientific-Grade AI  | Real-time, low-latency compute and coordination | Infra Layer    |

### üß† 1. Deep Intelligence Market
Economic Layer ‚Äî Redefining capital formation around intelligence as an asset class, backed by measurable contribution and utility.
#### Key Features:
- EVM-compatible Mainnet/Subnet architecture.
- Decentralized Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) + training models.
- Consensus via Proof-of-Intelligence in expert model routing/aggregation.
- Dynamic model selection to incentivize new entrants.
- Intelligence Mining ‚Äî Rewards based on compute + verifiable contribution.
- Native support for AI-for-Science workloads.

#### Economic Components:
- HETU Mining ‚Äî Mint tokens based on verifiable AI contribution (Proof of Execution & Contribution).
- AI-Stablecoin Payment Protocol ‚Äî Stake HETU to mint stablecoins for licensing, microtransactions, and event-based payments.
- AI-NativeCoin / AI RBO (Revenue-Based Offering) ‚Äî Tokenized, programmable cash flow rights for intelligence assets, enabling DeFi-style liquidity and financing.


### üß© 2. Truth Engine
Consensus & Attribution Layer ‚Äî Audits, attributes, and rewards AI based on real utility.
#### Core Mechanisms:
- Verifiable AI Utility ‚Äî Proofs for every inference, interaction, and data contribution.
- Proof of Causal Work (PoCW) ‚Äî Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of events and their causal relationships; rewards based on causal weight.
- Intersubjectivity Framework ‚Äî Bridges human metrics and agent-native consensus.
- Hyper-Scalability.

### ‚öôÔ∏è 3. Hyper-Scalable Layer 2
Execution Layer ‚Äî Scientific-grade AI computation with high throughput and low latency.
#### Performance Benchmarks:
- TPS: 210,000+
- Finality: 400ms

#### Architecture:
- Sequencer Layer ‚Äî Fast transaction ordering, real-time coordination.
- DAG-based BFT Layer ‚Äî High-throughput finality engine optimized for AI/science workloads.

## Subnet
| Vertical              | Focus                            | Core Mechanism                               |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| ü§ñ **AI Money**       | Monetization of intelligence     | \$AI-NativeCoin (CVF, RVF), AI-Stablecoins   |
| üî¨ **AI for Science** | Scientific data assetization     | Encrypted data pipelines, model licensing    |
| üí∏ **AIFi**           | Intelligence √ó Financial markets | AI √ó RWA, cash flow keys                     |

### ü§ñ AI Money
- Trades programmable cash flow rights (CVF, RVF).
- Verifiable cashflow auditing, real-time monetization, native AI yield loops.

### üî¨ AI for Science (AI4SCI)
- On-chain scientific provenance, dataset licensing, open AI/Science marketplaces.

### üí∏ AIFi ‚Äî Deep Intelligence Finance
- Brings RWA and capital markets on-chain.
