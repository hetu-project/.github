### What is Hetu
Hetu is an intersubjective attribution layer, bringing instant finality for off-chain systems. It is a hyper-scalable causality-based ground layer for deAIs, deSci, and longevity. Hetu is created by Advaita Labs with 10+ OSDI, SOSP, and NSDI papers in causality and distributed systems.

### Core Technology: Causality-Based Hyperscale Finality
- Features: Leveraging our verifiable logical clocks by TEE, Hetu implements fast causal ordering of both transactions and abstract AI events such as training of user data. Hetu also enables hyperscale AI-Native chains using DAG technologies, with a theoretical TPS of 160,000+. 
- Architecture: Hetu’s architecture combines a hyperscale chain offering rapid finality with a coordination layer designed for seamless interoperability. By leveraging causal ordering, the chain achieves scalable transaction throughput and near-instant transaction settlement. Meanwhile, its intersubjective layer establishes a common causality framework that unites disparate AI infrastructures and agent networks, allowing them to interact and evolve collectively within a coherent, interoperable ecosystem.

### Core Values: Interoperable Value Diffusion
Hetu facilitates the diffusion of value both within and between offchain systems, enabling instant finality for value attribution on-chain and transparent secure timestamping throughout the value distribution process. Its fundamental principles include hyper-scalable verifications, interoperable ordering mechanisms for incentivization, and robust anti-censorship governance tailored for DeAI collaborations By operating within a disruptive causality framework, Hetu empowers bootstrapping DeAI infrastructures and collaborative agent networks in a cost-effective, autonomous manner.

### Use Case: Interoperatable Ground Layer for DeAIs, DeSci and Longevity 
For equitable monetization and distributions of DeAIs, Hetu works as the real-time verifications and finality and also an anti-censorship and provenance sorter of AI Agents networks. Powered by Eigenlayer AVS and Ethereum, Hetu will be the ground layer for AI AVS and decentralized AI microservices, including 1) Hyperscale pre-confirmations for AI-related transactions and assets. 2) Real-time verifications and incentives for GPU platform, inference network and Edge AIs with lowest latency. 3)Verifiable framework for data-transmissions of data layers with fast accountability. 4) Shared sequencing for AI-Native chains with accountable fairness. 5) Anti-censorship voting for AI governance especially for personalized AIs.  

Also, Hetu is set to be the intersubjective ground layer for Desci, which provides a fast attribution layer and causality framework for Desci and Longevity. 1）Hyper scalable Desci chains for bootstrapping Desci protocols and assets  2）Attribution for longevity public networks and coordination for aging data layer  3）Decentralized social layers and incentives for Desci communities. Hetu partnered with Paramita which has granted 30+ desc and longevity in the last 2years, to build scientific alliances, research driven systems and scientists communities. Hetu is also backed by DAO5，Robot Venture, MH Venture, Paramita Venture and Eigenlayer. 
 
### Vision: Intersubjective Consensus
With a unique philosophy of intersubjective consensus, Hetu is envisioned to drive breakthroughs of entanglement between humans and AIs. Hetu unifies the power of decentralized science and community-first principles, aligning with the global scientists community. Since 2021, we have completed core research, building our testnet1.0 and plan to publish mainnet phase1 in Q2 of 2025.
